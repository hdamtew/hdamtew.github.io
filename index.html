----

Hello I'm Hanna Damtew, a passionate Data Scientist with a strong background in Computer Science and Data analytics fild of study . I specialized in turning complex data into actionable insights that drive decision-making and innovation. I have experience in various areas of data science, including: Data Analysis : Proicient in using tools like Python, R, and SQL to analyze and visualize data. Machine Learning: Skilled in building predicitve models and utilizing algorithms to slove real-world problems. Data Visualization: Adapt at crating compelling visualizations with livaraies like Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate findings effectivly.

I love working on challenging projects that allow me to apply my analytical skills and creativity. Some of my favorite projects include Predictive model for sales forcasting and data visualization dashboard. Outside of Data Science, I enjoy Traveling and meeting people of diffrent culture, walking . I am always eager to learn new techniques and stay updated on the latest trends in the field.

Projects: Project Title: Predictive Sales Forecasting Description: This project aimed to build a predictive model to forecast sales for a retail company, helping them optimize inventory management and improve sales strategies.

Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

Objective To crate an accurate sales forecasting model to help the company make data-driven inventory

Approach: Collected historical sales data and performed data cleaning. Analyze tends and seasoanlity using time series analysis Developed multiple machine learning models, including liner regeression and decision trees, to predict future slales. Results: Tthe final model achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting sales for the next quarter. the visualizations demonstrated key trends, aiding in strategic planning.
